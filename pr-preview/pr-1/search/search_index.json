In analog mode, the qubit is represented as in a ground state and a Rydberg state of an atom. The atoms are placed in user-specified arbitrary positions in a 2d space, and quantum computations can be enacted by driving the atoms between the ground and Rydberg state.

For more details on QuEra's cloud-accessible analog mode computer Aquila, please check out the Aquila whitepaper.</p>"},{"location":"background/#digital-mode","title":"Digital Mode","text":"<p>In the Digital Mode individual or multiple groups of qubits are controlled by applying gates (individual unitary operations). The digital mode qubit is represented in the two hyperfine clock ground states of the Rubidium 87 atom. These two states are extremely weakly interactive with the environment and other adjacent atoms, which leads to a very long coherence time upwards of 1 second. Single-qubit gates can be executed through a Raman laser drive coupling the two states to enact arbitrary rotations.</p> <p>Unlike Analog mode where the Rydberg state is persistent as part of the qubit encoding into the electronic states, digital mode only temporarily excites the atoms to the Rydberg state in order to interact with adjacent qubits, a process which typically takes less than ~1usec. Thus, a neutral atom entangling gate is executed by bringing multiple atoms together within the Rydberg blockade radius, and then doing some time-dependent drive between the hyperfine ground states and the Rydberg state, so that the final state returns to the hyperfine ground states. Due to the Rydberg blockade, only one atom can be in the Rydberg state at a time, which creates entanglement between the atoms. For more details see this paper on a recent demonstration of high fidelity gates.</p> <p>A unique advantage of reconfigurable neutral atom architectures is parallelism: the same laser can effect many lasers by aiming it in the same plane as the atom array. A single global Raman laser can enact the same parallel single-qubit gate on all qubits at the same time, and a single Rydberg laser (technically, two counter-propagating) can enact the same parallel multi-qubit gate on all cliques of qubits in an entangling region of the array. For more details see this paper on a recent demonstration of reconfigurable architectures. For this reason, it is important to represent quantum executions and circuits to be as parallel as possible. In our qasm2 dialect, we have extended qasm to natively include parallelism-- for example, <code>qasm2.parallel.cx(controls, targets)</code> represents a parallel CNOT gate between a list of <code>controls</code> on a list of <code>targets</code>.</p>"},{"location":"background/#reconfigurable-architectures-and-all-to-all-connectivity","title":"Reconfigurable architectures and \"all to all\" connectivity","text":"<p>A second advantage of reconfigurable neutral atom architectures is reconfigurability: atoms can be moved in parallel between sites in the array. QuEra's devices will have a zoned architecture, with distinct storage and entanglement zones and the ability to move atoms between them using a set of dynamic crossed AOD laser tweezers. This mobility can be considered as an efficient parallel swap gate, where any qubit can easily be moved to be adjacent to any other to enact entangling gates. For this reason, reconfigurable neutral atoms do not have a \"connectivity graph\" in the traditional sense-- instead, they have an \"all-to-all\" connectivity. There are still some technical constraints on this connectivity due to restrictions on the crossed AOD which we will detail when we open-source a move level dialect set in the near future.</p>"},{"location":"contrib/","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Please see Installation for instructions on how to set up your development environment.</p>"},{"location":"contrib/#pre-commit-hooks","title":"Pre-commit hooks","text":"<p>We use <code>pre-commit</code> to run the linter checks before you commit your changes.

Kirin programs are written as (compositions of) kernels -- subroutines that are intended to run on particular hardware (such as QPUs), or orchestrated to run on heterogeneous compute (such as a real-time classical runtime plus a QPU). These subroutines -- plus the built-in hybrid representations-- enable many key primitives, such as error correction.</p> <p>Additionally, the ability to compose functions together and to use typical classical programming structures like <code>if</code> and recursions enables many simplifications in writing complex circuits. In fact, recursions and the ability to dynamically allocate new memory (which is not known until runtime) enables many powerful subroutines and is natively enabled with Bloqade's kernel-based representation; for example, see this implementation of a repeat-until-success program.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/03/01/a-new-journey-for-bloqade/#analog-digital-logical-towards-real-quantum-utility","title":"Analog, digital, logical: towards real quantum utility","text":"<p>The first step in Bloqade's journey was building out the analog mode SDK, designed to interface with QuEra\u2019s cloud-accessible analog-mode neutral-atom quantum computer Aquila, as well as enable analysis and scientific discovery in analog quantum computing.

The QASM2 dialect is a simple quantum assembly language that allows you to write quantum circuits in a human-readable format. However, one should note that QASM2 is a very restricted language and does not support all the features of a high-level language.</p> <p>For example, there is a separation of gate routines declared with <code>gate</code> and main program written as a sequence of gate applications. While the gate routine is similar to a function in many ways, it does not support high-level features such as recursion (due to lack of <code>if</code> statement support inside) or control flows.</p> <p>Indeed, bloqade.circuits is designed with the notion of kernels in mind by decorating functions with a <code>@qasm2.extended</code> decorator. The python code is interpreted and parsed by the Kirin compiler toolchain and lowered to an abstract representation of the program. These kernels can include classical computation and the usual programming structures-- if/else, for and while loops, function inputs, and the like, as one is used to in Python.</p> <p>Additionally, the QASM2 representations of bloqade.circuits have been extended to include a key advantage of reconfigurable neutral atom hardware: parallelism. For example, one can represent a CZ gate applied to many qubit pairs at once as</p> <p><pre><code>@qasm2.extended\ndef parallel_cz(controls:ilist[qasm2.Qubit],targets:ilist[qasm2.Qubit]):\n    for ctr in range(len(controls)):\n        qasm2.cz(ctrl=controls[0],qarg=controls[1])\n</code></pre> or equivalently use a SIMD (single instruction multiple data)-like instruction to explicitly flag the parallelism <pre><code>@qasm2.extended\ndef simd_cz(controls:ilist[qasm2.Qubit],targets:ilist[qasm2.Qubit]):\n    qasm2.parallel.cz(ctrls=controls,qargs=targets)\n</code></pre> Both will ultimately emit the exact same QASM code, but the latter snippet represents the kind of parallelism that can be leveraged by reconfigurable neutral atom hardware to more efficiently execute a program.</p> <p>While in our initial release we support QASM2 as the first eDSL, we plan to use it as a compilation target instead of a programming language for long-term development.

gate noise is calculated using the following heuristic: The idle error is calculated by the total duration require to do the move and entable the qubits. Not every pair can be entangled at the same time, so we first deconflict the qargs assuming by finding subsets in which both the ctrl and the qarg qubits are in ascending order. This breaks the pairs into groups that can be moved and entangled separately. We then take each group and assign each pair to a gate zone slot. The slots are allocated by starting from the middle of the atoms and moving outwards making sure to keep the ctrl qubits in ascending order. The time to move a group is calculated by finding the maximum travel distance of the qarg and ctrl qubits and dviding by the move speed. The total move time is the sum of all the group move times. The error rate for all the qubits is then calculated by using the poisson_pauli_prob function. An additional error for the pick operation is calculated by joining the binary probabilities of the pick operation and the move operation.</p>"},{"location":"reference/bloqade/noise/native/model/#bloqade.noise.native.model.TwoRowZoneModel.assign_gate_slots","title":"assign_gate_slots","text":"<pre><code>assign_gate_slots(\n    ctrls: Sequence[int], qargs: Sequence[int]\n) -&gt; Dict[int, Tuple[int, int]]\n</code></pre> <p>Allocate slots for the qubits to move to. start from middle of atoms and move outwards making sure to keep the ctrl qubits in ascending order.</p> <p>Note that we can do this because the move strategy is to move the ctrl qubits separately from the qarg qubits, thus we don't have to worry about qarg qubits crossing the ctrl qubits and vice versa.
